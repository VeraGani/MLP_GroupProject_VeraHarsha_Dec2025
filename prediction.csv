"`` `` '' One Crazy Summer '' '' is the funniest , craziest ( not necessarily the best ) , movie I have ever seen. < br / > < br / > Just when one crazy scene is done , another emerges . It never lets you rest . Just one thing after another . The soundtrack is great . The songs are the right ones for the scenes. < br / > < br / > It is also a clean movie . Little that is dirty in it. < br / > < br / > Of course , it has the story of the guys you would n't trust with your lunch money , taking up a challenge , and winning over people with more resources . Who 'd want to see it if they failed ? There is a serious side , in that parents and children do not live up to each others ' dreams . One should always have an open mind , and weigh all the options . This applies both to parents and children . In `` '' One Crazy Summer '' '' , the parents are wrong . This is not always the case .

"`` And one of 'em are bad movies . The title , as it turns out , refers to a killer of the human male variety , not fish . This is not the Dante-directed `` '' Piranha '' '' of '78 ( which did have the fish ) and is also known as `` '' Piranha , Piranha . '' '' A trio of photographers , 2 men and a woman , hook up with a local hunter/trapper named Caribe somewhere in the Amazon jungle . Unfortunately , they are not familiar with the film resume of William Smith , who plays Caribe ; otherwise , they would have known immediately he is the villain of the piece . Smith may have also refused to film the ending or cut out before they finished filming ( see end of this comment ) . < br / > < br / > As mentioned elsewhere , this pic has a lot of filler - lengthy shots of the local wildlife ( birds ) - and the central set piece , a motorcycle race , which goes on too long . The reason this gets a second star from me is , of course , William Smith , who ca n't really save this sludge , but once again proves why he was the 'go to ' guy 30-35 years ago if you needed a really nasty villain ; at his best , Smith could be really terrifying . He 's the type who enjoys killing , possibly in sadistic fashion , and you get that sense from the evil grin he usually puts on when a mood strikes him . Physically , he 's very imposing , and you know the other 3 characters are pretty much doomed within the first half-hour . This was what Smith brought to most of his roles ; it seems hopeless for the other characters against this manlike monster . Unfortunately , the movie continues to muddy things up to the very end , as if a minute of footage was lost - a confusing , incomplete climax . ''",0,1
"Being a seasoned fan of Italian thrillers and directors Dario Argento , Mario Bava , Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado , I thought of Lucio Fulci as an overrated hack . I had seen The Beyond which I think is totally overrated , I found The New York Ripper to be simply appalling and I did n't particularly like The House By the Cemetery . These three movies left me to conclude that Fulci is the least interesting of these Italian filmmakers . But my stubbornness prevailed and I had to check out more of his films . City of the Living Dead was a film I found very interesting but Do n't Torture a Duckling is very nearly a masterpiece. < br / > < br / > Set in a small town in the Italian countryside in a repressive religious community where young boys are being murdered . The authorities are clueless as to who 's behind these crimes , especially after their prime suspect has been cleared . An eager young reporter along with a rather slutty girl ( who seduces young boys ) investigate and eventually get to the bottom of it. < br / > < br / > Brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a good cast ( not always the case with 70 's Italian thrillers ) make Do n't Torture a Duckling a crackling good thriller . The plot is well constructed , not easily figured out and the end conclusion is very satisfying . Fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of repression and guilt in a very unforgiving and ignorant community and creates some very strong visuals , particularly in a scene where a woman gets beaten to death by some local townsfolk . Fulci 's social commentary concerning religion and innocence are quite edgy and every aspect is well handled . When thinking of his zombie flicks and his ultra violent giallo New York Ripper it 's amazing how well he balances his critique with explicit violence and makes an even stronger point . So far I have n't seen any Fulci film made as professionally as this one. < br / > < br / > While not a traditional giallo film , Duckling has many of the genre 's trademarks . Fulci displays complete control over the format , only once going overboard with an unconvincing gore-moment , but overall he seems to be even better at making mysteries than full blown gore epics . The extreme scenes here are much more powerful and really pack a punch. < br / > < br / > So far Do n't Torture a Duckling is Fulci 's best film by far in my opinion . Edgy social commentary combined with explicit scenes of violence and a crackling good mystery to boot .",1,1
"A total and utter travesty of a movie . 'Dark power'is the kind of film even troma would be embarrassed to release.The script , direction , acting and action sequence 's are so dire as to be almost painful to watch and one cant help thinking that it 's mere 75 minute running time could have been better spent . The above reviewer must be related to the director as that 's the only reason i can see for his/her appraisal of this rubbish , some might call it b-movie fun or 'so bad it 's good ' just to excuse there enjoyment of it , but when the lead actor ( and most experienced cast member ) cant deliver his lines convincingly you know you 've got a very , very bad movie.Avoid at all costs .",0,0
"I must say I was disappointed with this film . Although it is well acted and directed , the underlying story simply plods along too slowly. < br / > < br / > Granted , in another mood I would have liked it better . I did chuckle a lot , but rarely laughed out loud ; and there was actually a sense of suspense to discover who won . But in contrast to another movie that my wife picked up the same day ( one neither of us had heard of before ) this one paled in comparison. < br / > < br / > If you see lots of movies , then by all means see this -- it 's distinctly better than your average fare . But if you ( like me ) have limited time and want to watch only the best and most entertaining , save this for later. < br / > < br / > [ Rate : 7/10 ]",0,0
"This is an excellent movie . Phoolan had no role model 's to base her actions on , yet was able to bring about very necessary change to a land that was living in darkness when it comes to female treatment . I like the fact that it was a real story rather than made up , it added to the horror of the story , & the triumph .",1,1
"This has got to be the worst show I have ever seen . I always liked Chuck Norris in Films , but why do we need to make these shows politically correct by adding a black side kick who is as threatening as Shirley Temple in Little Miss Marker . I also thought the show was limited because how many times can you kick a guy in the face and make it interesting . I know an African American who looks like this Trivette guy and he gets his butt kicked about once a week he is all attitude. < br / > < br / > Chuck Norris is the man and he deserves all the kudos he gets , I think this show started great but lost steam as time went on < br / > < br / > They should have dumped Chucks side kick",0,1
"`` Maybe if you smoked enough weed this would seem funny or would make you nostalgic for how completely unhinged people allowed themselves to be in the early 70 's . There 's an odd innocence to this movie and the sex is a lot more awkward and playful than the steely pros who do it for the cameras now. < br / > < br / > The real curio here - and really the only reason to watch this movie - is the appearance of Kristine Debell as Alice . She was a Ford model and it shows . She 's got classic , WASP-ish good looks - like a really cute Ivy League sorority girl . So what the hell is she doing in this cheap , cheesy skin flick ? From my vantage point she does not appear to be at all on drugs in this movie ( which might explain it ) and she actually seems incredibly committed to the part . When she sings her first song she really does act like she thinks she 's flippin ' Julie Andrews or something . I just get the feeling that this girl truly believed this was gon na be her big break or something , instead of the near career killer that it was . Anyway , she is damn cute and you kind of ca n't believe she would even get naked on screen , much less do a masturbation scene , a couple of oral sex scenes ( with men and women ) and then do the real deal as a climax to the film ( snark ) . It is also definitely not a body double at all . That is our little Kristine taking one for the team , or for the greater glory of showbiz or something . It 's pretty amazing to watch and it is definitely stimulating ( ahem ) but in a way I kinda wish she had n't done it . That was a very pretty , talented young girl getting some really bad advice. < br / > < br / > Anyway , my guess is that Kristine Debell , wherever she is , has long , long since wished this movie would go away . She was very cute and appealing in `` '' Meatballs . '' '' Almost impossible to believe this is the same girl - but it is . ''",0,0
"`` `` '' Empire Strikes Back '' '' director Irvin Kershner 's `` '' Never Say Never Again , '' '' a remake of the 1965 James Bond movie `` '' Thunderball , '' '' does n't surpasses the Terence Young original , but this non-Harry Saltzman & Albert R. Broccoli film is well worth watching if you call yourself a 007 aficionado . Nevertheless , despite its shortage of clever gadgets and the lack of a vibrant musical score , `` '' Never Say Never Again '' '' rates as an above-average , suspenseful doomsday thriller with top-flight performances by a seasoned cast including Sean Connery , Kim Basinger , Klaus Maria Brandauer , Max Von Sydow , Barbara Carrera , Edward Fox , Bernie Casey , Alec McCowen , and Rowan Atkinson . The film bristles with surprises galore from the invigorating title credits sequence throughout its generally exciting but lengthy 134 minutes . Unlike the franchise James Bond sagas with their breath-taking moments of spectacle , `` '' Never Say Never Again '' '' provides few of these scenes because of its prohibitive budget . Indeed , the film features only three gadgets : an explosive ball-point pen , a wristwatch with a laser , and a souped-up motorcycle . Aside from the flavorful Lani Hall opening theme song , `` '' Ice Station Zebra '' '' composer Michel Legrand 's orchestral music score leaves much to be desired . Legrand replicates none of those snappy , jazz cues that made John Barry 's music for the regular Bond franchise so memorable . All in all , `` '' Never Say Never Again '' '' seems to fit more into the first two Bond movies '' '' Dr. No '' '' and `` '' From Russia With Love '' '' and `` '' On Her Majesty 's Secret Service '' '' in terms of its more down to earth approach to the subject matter. < br / > < br / > '' '' Never Say Never Again '' '' presents Sean Connery 's James Bond as an older 007 who has seen his day and has been taken off active service to teach . Ironically , Roger Moore was a year older than Connery and Moore 's Bond movies treated 007 as an active , young guy . Sean Connery seems to be responsible for making 007 a more mature secret agent and a number of changes take place in the Lorenzo Semple screenplay that emphasize Bond 's age . Initially , Connery had lobbied to play Bond without a hairpiece , but mercifully wiser minds prevailed and Connery sports a hairpiece . He looks tanned and fit and appears in better condition than he did twelve years earlier when he was rushed into `` '' Diamonds Are Forever '' '' at the last moment to replace John Gavin . Connery had been working on another movie and had gained weight for the role that he was unable to remove in time for `` '' Diamonds Are Forever . '' '' At 52 , Connery still has a youthful vigor here despite the contrived demands of the script. < br / > < br / > The action unfolds with 007 single-handedly trying to rescue a kidnapped woman on a remote desert island . He dispatches several guards armed with machine guns and frees the woman , only to have her stab him with a knife in the side when he is n't looking . It seems that this entire sequence was an exercise designed by M ( Edward Fox of `` '' Day of the Jackal '' '' ) to test Bond 's ability . The new M does n't share his predecessor 's use of field agents . M decides that Bond needs to clean out his system of all 'free radicals ' and has 007 packed off to Shrublands . While at the country clinic , Bond notices suspicious activity between a nurse and a patient and gets noticed watching them . The nurse is none other than SPECTRE assassin Fatima Blush ( Barbara Carrera of `` '' The Island of Dr. Moreau '' '' ) and she is in charge of making sure that nobody sees USAF officer Jack Petachi ( Gavan O'Herlihy of `` '' Superman 3 '' '' ) . Petachi is part of a SPECTRE plan by millionaire businessman Maximilian Largo ( Klaus Maria Brandauer of `` '' Out of Africa '' '' ) to black the world powers by stealing two nuclear warheads . The villains implant a duplicate eyeball into Captain Petachi who has access to the highly sophisticated computers and can order the arming of weapons . After he steals the weapons for SPECTRE , Fatima Blush runs him off the road by tossing her pet snake in his lap and then attaches an explosive to his wrecked car and blows him up . Indeed , the first part of `` '' Never Say Never Again , '' '' apart from the SPECTRE planning conference , belong to Fatima as she supervises Petachi 's stay at the clinic and then repeatedly tries to kill Bond , one at sea with sharks and later in a motel suite with an explosives device. < br / > < br / > Eventually , Bond meets the beautiful blond Domino ( Kim Basinger of `` '' Mother Lode '' '' ) and sneaks into Largo 's charity banquet at a Monte Carlo casino where the two face off in an elaborate video game called 'Domination ' to see who will rule the world . Bond bests him and Largo hates him doubly now because 007 is his only rival to Domino and a thorn in his side that not even Fatima seems to be able to remove . Bond and Fatima have it out after a motorcycle chase when he returns the favor and blows her up . Their earlier encounter in the Bahamas when she attached a device to lure a shark after him is pretty lame . Like in the original `` '' Thunderball , '' '' the villains recover the hijacked nuclear warheads at sea , but just the warheads themselves. < br / > < br / > Bond flies to the Bahamas where he meets his diplomatic liaison , Nigel Small-Fawcett ( no lesser than Rowan Atkinson of `` '' Mr. Bean '' '' fame , who is worried that Bond may kill somebody and ruin the island paradise . Of course , Nigel Small-Fawcett serves as the film 's source of comic relief . The C.I.A . sends Felix Leiter ( Bernie Casey of `` '' Guns of the Magnificent Seven '' '' ) to back up Bond . This is the first time that an African-American portrayed Leiter . Bond encounters his share of problems , involving saving Domino from Arab slavers , while Leiter and he save the world . `` `` Never Say Never Again '' '' is a richly respectable James Bond thriller with many neat touches , but it never generates the air of danger that the franchise Bond films have . Indeed , `` '' Never Say Never Again '' '' looks like a dignified Masterpiece Theatre take on 007 . ''",1,1
"Meryl Streep as Kate , a woman dying of cancer , performs her role admirably . No wonder she was up for an Oscar . In the part she proves that caring and nurturing housewives are just as important as their sisters out in the business world . And the lesson she teaches about life 's expectations and their lack of fulfillment as the relationship grows , that is the most important thing she teaches her daughter . We can expect too much of our mates . Realize that there are many slips and forgiveness or understanding are the main ingredients of a happy life . This is a sombre movie and the ending though sad , shows reconciliation between the father and daughter . I give this one a ten .",1,1
"This is not your typical Indian film . There is some great sense of humanity , and the characters are pretty realistic . There is great dynamism in the interpersonal relationships , and there is a sense of guilt , grief , passion , passivity among the many characters . While seeing this , one gets a feel for the heavy burden of the 5000 years of layers and layers of history of social existence of one of the oldest civilizations . The final scene of an elephant walking away in the rural area was a great footnote to such a ancient civilization , and yet , human relations are still preserved and nurtured . Saw it on DVD , the two interviews with the director and the main actress are very interesting . Was surprised to learn that the movie has not done well ( or not being shown ) in India ( ... but maybe not too surprised ) . The artistic patrimony of rural societies is being slowly lost and its inheritance not picked up by younger generations , as some of the older musicians in the movie are no longer living today . Great film .",1,1
"`` This is the greatest example I can think of to prove the theory that when Hollywood runs out of good ideas , they make an awful sequel and ruin the first one . Now do n't get me wrong , I absolutely love the first Beastmaster ; I even liked the third one pretty good , but this movie is atrocious . I am a huge fantasy/sword & sorcery movie fan and I hated to see such a terrible sequel made to such a classic as the first Beastmaster . So why do I hate this movie so much ? Well , where do I begin ? First of all , the whole idea of the movie is ridiculous . Dar and his evil older brother Arklon ( who was nowhere mentioned in the first movie..Huh ? ) cross over into our world via a handy dimensional time-portal gate . Ya see , Earth just happens to be on the same parallel interdimentional plane as Dar 's world . Whereas with the first movie , you 're led to think the movie just takes place in the past , but with this one you 're shown it 's a completely whole other world altogether ... that 's just one of the many things I hated about this sequel . It did n't work with `` '' Masters of the Universe '' '' , and it sure does n't work here either ! Movies like this should take place and stay in their own time-line and their usual surroundings . For Christ 's sake , what 's next ? Hercules in New York ... er , uh..bad example ! Moving on ... < br / > < br / > Arklon 's after a device called a neutron detonator to use as a threat against his enemies to rule his own kingdom . So , it 's up to Dar , his ferrets , his eagle , and his tiger ( not a spray-painted one this time ) to go off and save the world ... but along the way they have the help of a young , cool , and hip Senator 's daughter who gets caught up in this whole mess and she show 's Dar around L.A. , takes him for a joyride in her BMW , and helps get him out of tight situations here and there . How convenient right ? And speaking of convenient , I found it awfully convenient and easy for Arklon to sneak into a highly guarded military base and get away with a stolen , highly destructive nuclear weapon ... even with half the U.S. Army and L.A.P.D . after him ... .waaaaay to easy , even for an evil barbarian sorcerer from another world . There are sooo many plot holes in this I do n't know where to begin ; like why did Arklon go to the L.A. zoo for at the end of the movie ? ! ? He absolutely has no reason whatsoever to go there ; and would n't that be like the last place you 'd lure your greatest enemy who just so happens to have the handy ability TO CONTROL ANIMALS ? < br / > < br / > And do n't you just love these kinds of movies where the police are portrayed as total idiots and even with half a dozen cops firing at one guy , they still do n't manage to hit him ? The police in this movie belong in the `` '' Police Academy '' '' series ! They are about as useful in this movie as reading glasses are for the blind ! Even the title of the movie makes no sense : `` '' Beastmaster 2 : Through the Portal of Time '' '' ... they never actually went through a `` '' time '' '' portal because the movie is n't set in the future of Dar 's world , it 's set in a parallel world along ours in the astral plane , so they NEVER actually go through time , only a dimensional world along theirs ; so NO actual time-travel is involved at all ! This movie tries to come off as funny and it does ... not because of the humor , but because it 's just so bad ... and that 's putting it mildly . The acting , dialogue , plot , characters , and ending are all so cheesy it 's hilarious . What more can I expect from the guy that brought us `` '' Return of the Swampthing '' '' ( another bad sequel ) ? Sorely missed here is Don Coscarelli 's wonderful directing and serious feel of the first one ! ! Avoid this stinking piece of garbage like the bubonic plague and stick which the first one and maybe the third one if there 's nothing better on T.V . ''",0,0

This movie insults your intelligence with not only the story line , but also with the lack of realistic locations . For example , in the scene depicting the Inaugural Parade , the First Lady is in a Rolls Royce convertible with agent Killion and without the President .

"`` Out of all the films I could have chosen , it had to be this . When I was last in New York I went into a Times Square store and out of the hundreds of DVD 's they had I chose Joel M. Reeds Bloodsucking Freaks ( 1976 ) and this , on a double feature DVD that also included Seeds of Sin ( 1968 ) , did I regret it ? Read on to find out . The film opens on an island ( near Milligan 's Staten Island home ) where two lovers are walking along with a massive parasol seemingly made from paper , at one point he gives her the top of a weed as a gift . Out of nowhere Colin ( Hal Borske ) a retarded hunchback pops up and kills both of them for no reason at all . After the opening credits which are joined by some of the worst headache inducing music I have ever heard , at least it got me used to it as it 's used constantly throughout the film , we are introduced to three couples . The wives are all sisters , Vicky ( Ann Linden ) and Ricard ( Fib LaBlaque ) , Veronica ( Eileen Hayes ) and Bill ( Don Williams ) plus Elizabeth ( Carol Vogel ) and Donald ( Richard Ramos ) . They each receive a letter from a lawyer , H. Dobbs ( Neil Flanagan ) that request a meeting so he can read their late father 's will . Dobbs informs them that they must spend three days in their childhood home 'Crenshaw House ' and fill it with 'sexual harmony and marital love ' that it had never known because of the strained relationship between their father and mother . He informs the couples that the will is highly irregular but legal . After three days the inheritance will be settled . The couples are also told about the servants , Martha ( Veronica Radburn ) , Hattie ( Maggie Rodgers ) and the retarded Colin , who welcomes the couples by killing and biting chunks out of a rabbit in front of them . Later on that night whats left of the dead rabbit is found in one of the couples beds with a note that says 'blessed are the meek , for they shall inherit ' . This starts a series of events which end in gruesome murder and reveals dark family secrets. < br / > < br / > Co-written , photographed and directed by the talentless Andy Milligan . This is an absolutely horrible film in every way possible . Lets go through just some of it 's faults . The music , it 's awful and headache inducing . Sound , you can barely hear what characters are saying and certain scenes do n't have any sound effects plus at certain points you can hear Milligan shouting out orders to his actors , oh and there 's a constant hiss on the soundtrack throughout as well . The acting , probably among the worst I have ever witnessed . The very un-special effects , Colin pokes someones eye out in the opening sequence , it 's the size of a tennis ball , the part where someone is tied down and has his stomach opened up with a saw looks really awful as are the various hands and legs that are chopped off . Photography , Milligan has absolutely no idea how to stage or film a scene , he regularly cuts the top , bottom or sides of peoples heads and faces off the screen and his camera jerks and shakes around like it 's operated by someone who is constantly tripping over . There is also at least one scene so badly thought out and filmed that a crew member is seen . The film is often so dark you ca n't see whats happening , too . Editing , again some of the worst I 've ever sat through , he seems to cut scenes before they 've finished , cutting away while characters are in the middle of a sentence . The script , if there was one , credited to both Milligan and Hal Sherwood ( It took two people to write this ! ? ) is all over the place and is incredibly stupid . There is one unbelievably bad sequence where the killer follows a victim down into the basement , the killer walks right behind him , at one point the potential victim turns around . What does the killer do to avoid being spotted ? They duck down right in from of him , the killers close enough to give the guy oral sex yet he does n't notice them , right in front of him . You have to see this sequence to believe it , I still ca n't believe what I saw . Bizarre sub plots just happen and then totally disappear , check the scene out when Richard has to borrow money from his brother Walter ( producer and co-writer Hal Sherwood ) , who turns out to be a gay priest who has had an incestuous relationship with his brother before he was married ! A strange scene that 's there for no reason at all . Martha the housekeepers reaction to the first murder , she 's more bothered by the fact that it 's thrown her dinner schedule out ! There 's load of insane dialogue as well , Patty and Martha discuss Colin , Patty says `` '' if only I did n't beat him so hard '' '' Martha sympathetically replies `` '' you have to Patty , you have to ! `` `` , delivered totally straight faced . And do n't start me on how ugly the wallpaper looks throughout the house ! The only good thing I can think of saying is that the costumes look reasonable , for the time period it 's meant to be set in . I could probably go on all day about how amateurish this is , but I think you get the idea . One to avoid unless your a serious masochist ! I did n't regret buying or watching it for a second , though ! ''",0,0
"THE LATE SHIFT was an interesting made for HBO movie that took a detailed look at the power struggle that ensued between David Letterman and Jay Leno when Johnny Carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him . This struggle is now part of Hollywood folklore , but for those who do n't know the story and are aware of where Letterman is now , it might be interesting to learn that David Letterman wanted to replace Johnny Carson as host of THE TONIGHT SHOW more than anything in the world , but Letterman found his dreams being derailed as frequent guest host Leno had one of Hollywood 's most powerful agents , Helen Kushnick , in his corner and working tirelessly to get her client the job . It 's not often that we get to see behind the scenes Hollywood machinations recreated for entertainment value , but for fans of these two late night superstars , this movie provided a fascinating look at a very turbulent period in late night television . According to this movie , Letterman was practically promised the job by Carson himself while NBC had promised the job to Leno and that 's where Helen Kushnick came in . The movie presents Leno as sort of a milquetoast who allowed his career to be manipulated by Kushnick and feigned ignorance to some of Helen 's strong-willed manipulations of some of NBC 's biggest power players and it presents Letterman as this smart and savvy businessman who , despite having Carson 's support , was railroaded by NBC and Kushnick . John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck credibly recreate Letterman and Leno , respectively , but it is the razor-sharp performance of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Helen Kushnick that keeps this movie bubbling . Bates commands the screen in one of her best , if not so well-known performances as the venomous Hollywood agent who eats television studio executives for breakfast . There is also a wonderful turn by impressionist Rich Little as Johnny Carson , but it is primarily a fascinating story and the powerhouse performance by Bates that make this one worth checking out .",1,1

"`` In fact it was awful . The main chick in it who gets topless was obviously sleeping with the director at the time . It was shot at some warehouse most likely owned by family or friends . Also they chose not to bother coming up with a story . Sure these are ways to cut cost , but are they smart ways of keeping costs down ? No they are n't . At the very least they could have found a middle school student in a `` '' creative writing '' '' course . Those kids may have at least had a lesson about story structure . At the very least , they could have read up on 3 act structure but acting obviously was n't a priority either . Watching these jerks run around in funny clothing that was stupid by 1980 's standards was an embarrassment . The fact that none of these actors committed suicide in humiliation is probably a testament to the limited distribution this film received . Had the actors actually seen the final result of their hard work , there would have been a line of people waiting to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. < br / > < br / > I 'd give this movie 10/10 stars but it only deserves 1 for being released at all .

"`` First there are some plot holes in this movie . We see in the very beginning a kid dies from playing the game . But who was tied up in the mail truck delivering the package which contains the game ? How did the driver place the package into the mailbox when he was lashed to the steering wheel ? It is not like he was Mr . Fantastic . Wow that in just the first 15 minutes ... The actors are second rate , take the `` '' Bad Guy '' '' played by Patrick Kilpatrick ( who ? ) exactly he has appeared in one episode of everything on TV and some secondary roles in poor movies ( like this one ) . So most of the acting is like TV dramas , I can live with that , but the graphics or special effects are horrible . The disembodied `` '' Game '' '' voice sounds like a poor clone of Hal from `` '' Space Oddessy 2000 '' '' . What they called Zombies looked more like shadows jumping around like monkeys from `` '' Planet of the Apes '' '' . The Aliens had transparent bodies like the shadow zombies .

"This movie is very similar to Death Warrant with Jean-Claude Van Damme and also has some similarities to Island of Fire with Jackie Chan and I also heard that there is some other very similar action movies , but this film has a much better action than Death Warrant or even Island of Fire ( that 's right , the Jackie Chan 's movie ) . Rarely American action movies has such a great action sequences , though there was many negative reviews on this film , it easily beats most of the action movies of that time who were more successful . There were many martial art 's scenes , David Bradley was fast as Bruce Lee in this film and what else was good , that fighting scenes were much longer than in most of the American martial art 's movies . The shoot-out scenes were similar with John Woo 's movies , maybe not that good , but still very exiting . There was also many impressive explosions and one great chase scene . I 've seen some other David Bradley 's movies , but this one , yet is the best in terms of action . OK , this movie has some cheesy moments , but which movie has n't ? The acting was decent , Charles Napier was incredible and his character was real tough . Adam Clark who played Squid and Yuji Okumoto who played the main bad guy were also very good . Other actors acted pretty well too , though the acting is n't important in this type of movies . If you are action movies fan ( I mean the real action movies fan , who really can appreciate the good action ) , than you must see this film .",1,1

"Joseph Conrad 's timeless novel , Heart of Darkness , was depicted in the 1994 movie . I have read Conrad 's novel , and I must say , even though I prefer the novel itself , the movie was a great depiction . The set and costume designs brought Conrad 's novel to life on the screen as we followed Marlow 's journey . The acting also brought the characters to life through the mannerisms , voices , and personalities . If you have read the novel , I recommend that you also view this movie . If you have not read the novel , however , the movie may be harder to follow . Conrad 's Heart of Darkness is too full of action , emotion , and information to be made into a movie that is a little over an hour and a half long . Therefore , if you have not read the novel , the plot in the movie may seem too cluttered to follow . Overall I gave this movie a seven out of ten . The basic plot of the novel was brought forth to the screen with great sets , costumes , and acting . Nothing can replace Joseph Conrad 's original work however .",1,1
"I ... I do n't know where to begin . Dragon Hunt might just be the worst film in cinematic history . Even Anus Magilicutty was better than this , as it was intentionally bad . Showgirls ? No , it had kitsch value and was technically a well made film . But Dragon Hunt takes the cake , and eats it , then vomits it back up and feeds it to a homeless man . It 's that much of a travesty. < br / > < br / > The acting , if it can even be called that , is rough . It does n't have the charm of improvised acting , so it must be scripted , but it 's recited with an almost malicious tone of poor quality . Several lines were delivered in a way that shows the actors ( or basically , those people on screen ) either regretted being connected to this film or were thinking of a particularly humorous joke from Saturday Night Live , which they had watched prior to getting in front of the camera . I could write another three paragraphs on the quality of acting in this film , but you and I both do n't want to hear it. < br / > < br / > The make-up and special effects ( which , with most films , is the only good thing ) was laughably bad . The antagonist , whose name is so ridiculous I ca n't remember it , has a Mohawk glued to the top of his head . Yeah , glued to his head . And you can tell it 's glued on too , if you look at the spot where it meets his pockmarked skull you can see a plastic strip , not unlike the ones on fake eyelashes . Thankfully he 's pretty much the only example of make-up no-nos in the film. < br / > < br / > There 's also some terrible character development , to put it lightly . The women , who are strangely rough handled by the supposedly benevolent fugly brothers ( and I mean , they are really pushed around ) , are not only ugly but ... gasp ... they do n't know what they 're doing ! In one scene they turn on their apparent lovers , join up with the even uglier bad guy , and then snort some coke . Apparently they managed to get their hands on some really good cocaine , because they started shaking and laughing EVEN before all of it went up their nostrils . Great timing girls ! Plus they wear some truly horrible stuff , clothes that belong solely in the late 80s and early 90s. < br / > < br / > Overall this movie , this film , this waste of film I should say , is also a waste of time . Watching it will hurt you , and will require the suspension of not only your belief , but also of your entire brain . If you want to get stoned with your friends and have some good laughs , see if you can get this film ( you 'll probably have to download it ) otherwise , do n't even think about it .

"I saw this in 1993 on a VHS tape but have been unable to find it at any source since . This is a very bleak and uncompromising look at the last days of the Japanese Army in the Phillipines . Anyone with an interest in the Pacific war would do well to view this film and see what conditions the other side fought under.From what I can tell , this is historically accurate , and depicts how easily men can descend into complete barbarism . I understand the Japanese Army was completely cut off from any re-supply in the Phillipines by 1945 , so there is no doubt many of the horrific incidents depicted here happened . I might not have been able to identify with the film 's characters , but I appreciate their humanity and struggle to survive . If I had to compile a list of the ten greatest war films , this film would be on it . See it if you can get it .",1,1
"`` Because Mr. Bean almost never speaks , I heartily recommend using a DVD player with the teacher holding his finger over the pause/play button .

Nothing wrong with that until it 's revealed her character is from Philidelphia in the United States ! This what struck me about this thriller while watching it - The way accents do n't match their characters . Apart from the Philly woman with a German accent we see a South African with an English accent , a local police chief who sounds like he 's an Irishman impersonating a Gestapo officer and worst of all George C Scott playing someone who 's either Dutch or British with an accent that sounds like it might be American tinged with South African . You soon give up following what 's on screen and end up concentrating on what nationality a character might be due to the strange way they speak . It 's interesting to note that this site has n't given this movie a country of origin . With so many different actors from different countries you do feel that this was produced by the United Nations < br / > < br / > Even if you 're not curious about accents or dialects you 'll probably have to give up following the action anyway because CURACAO is plot less .

"This version of Mansfield Park , while being extremely accurate to the novel lacked the compassion I felt for Fanny which is crucial and central to this Jane Austen story . This was due to the total lack of acting ability by the actress , Sylvestra Le Touzel . She had no appeal and at times appeared to be either lost in space or out of her depth . The scene she has with her uncle where she breaks down in hysterics was hysterical . She badly overplayed that crucial scene and I actually felt sorry that Henry Crawford ever cared for her. < br / > < br / > The polar opposite is the portrayal of Mary Crawford by Jackie Smith- Wood . What a wonderful actress , in a very difficult part to make that character witty and self-centered , selfish yet vulnerable to love. < br / > < br / > I have always loved Fanny . She is mild mannered but with an implacable sense of what is right , and who she thinks is worthy of respect and admiration . The Fanny in this adaptation is too meek and subservient with hardly a thought of her own until near the end of the series . As much as I wanted to like this Fanny ... .I just could not . < br / > < br / > I suggest skipping this version of Mansfield Park for the real thing ... the Novel . Fanny will not disappoint ... you will Love Her !",0,0
"`` I liked most of the dialogue , I liked the cast , I thought it was well acted . I particularly enjoyed Ellen DeGeneres ' perfect deadpan performance. < br / > < br / > What did n't work for me was : ( 1 ) the drawn-out affair with the younger man ( too long , too seemingly out of character for Helen ) , ( 2 ) the seemingly endless cinematic cliches , mostly visual but including interminable voiced over re-readings of the love letter itself ( its contents should have a mystery ) ; ( 3 ) a young woman feminist-scholar and , ironically , a fireworks scene ( no wonder this reminded me of that horrid How to Make an American Quilt movie ) ; ( 4 ) the bumbling `` '' gotcha '' '' cop who smells `` '' dope '' '' everywhere ( no cliche there either ! ) ; and ( 5 ) a nauseatingly romanticized small town setting. < br / > < br / > I would have preferred the film to more persuasively explore the source of ( or even glorify ) Helen 's bitterness , to have included much more of DeGeneres ' character , to have eliminated or reduced the various intergenerational artifices , and to be a little less uncritical of small town life. < br / > < br / > Had it been developed as a play first , those criticisms might have been addressed before committing the material to this film , which unfortunately is decidedly mediocre .

"All the hype ! All the adds ! I was bummed that I missed this on the big screen . Where this film worked was in the little details . In EVERYTHING else it failed . Arnold has done so many better performances in the past few years . I thought the days of Commando and Last Action Hero were gone from our lives . Sadly this film panders to the lowest common denominator and reduces Arnold to a bellowing , grunting , face contorting muscle that just knows how to shoot guns and blow things up . In a cliche last moment ( and at one other time ) , that was predictable from the start , we see a glimmer of the actor that has proven he is more than what he got paid for early in his career .

The leader of their group , a conceited black-magic enthusiast and possible homosexual , attempts to summon Satan 's help with the re-animation of an exhumed body , which fails so they take the corpse to the nearby , deserted caretaker 's house and play with it ... Nothing interesting happens until the last fifteen minutes or so when the undead finally spring from their graves and go after the desecrater 's . The make-up effects are okay , the gore is VERY minimal ( PG rating ) , and the extremely irritating characters are focused on way to much , which really got on my nerves . I guess having group of terrible actors bickering for an hour was suppose to equal some `` '' comedic '' '' status , yet I found no humor in it , whatsoever . The entire concept is just ridiculous - how these kids are willing to dig up and monkey around with a dead body for as long as they did .

"`` What was this , a Zucker brothers movie ? I do n't mind a little humor in my Holmes ( I 'm a big fan of Billy Wilder 's `` '' The Private Life of SH '' '' ) , but this version of `` '' The Sign of Four '' '' feels like a Grand-Guignol-esque episode of `` '' Murder , She Wrote '' '' ( right from the opening credits , that are of the worst possible kind : a montage of scenes from the movie ) as directed by Mel Brooks . Ian Richardson is a fine actor , and certainly looks the part ( he 's a dead ringer to those drawings from The Strand ! ) , but his interpretation of the character is all wrong and overly humorous , from the silly smile he frequently sports ( I thought the drug Holmes was into was cocaine , not weed ) to his expressions of comical stiffness in the carnival sequences . Not to mention that when he disguises himself as an old man , he is so over the top that despite the fine makeup we instantly recognize him . David Healy is an unmemorable but , given the circumstances , acceptable Watson , and is not too much of a buffoon ... at least not more than the rest of characters . Cherie Lunghi ( Excalibur ) plays Mary Morstan in an exaggerated ingenue fashion straight out of a 1930s vaudeville. < br / > < br / > Story-wise , there are some pointless additions ( like giving Tonga vampire teeth , an appetite for raw meat and a carnival pit as a place to live , turning him into a reject from Island of Dr. Moreau ) , and we are even denied the pleasure of discovering the mystery alongside Holmes , as we are well informed of everything way before Holmes finds out . And this is full of tired clichés : not only we get the infamous catchphrase `` '' Elementary , my dear Watson '' '' ( which , as any Sherlockian will know , Conan Doyle never ever wrote ) , but we are exposed to such blatant commonplaces as having Hindi music pop out of nowhere when Holmes goes to see a white guy in Hindi clothes. < br / > < br / > Bottom line : In Britain , in the eighties , two rival TV companies attempted to create a long-running series of Sherlock Holmes adaptations , and produced initial TV-movies as potential pilots .

I notice it is n't listed here as a comedy so they must be serious ! It 's basically seems to be about a gang of pensioners who ride round on motorcycles shooting at each other and exchanging the most hilariously bad dialogue you can imagine .

"`` Anthony Wong plays Lok , a husband whose wife is seriously ill.Poor Lok-due to her illness he has been going without sex for a long time.That 's why he is plagued by a series of sleazy nightmares featuring nurses and schoolgirls . `` `` Erotic Nightmare '' '' is a fun Cat III flick loaded with sleaze and voyeurism.There is also a bit of gore as the first part of the film shows some nasty killings committed by Wong character under the influence of the monk 's mystical powers.The dream sequences are quite erotic and sleazy , so I 'm not complaining.Of course those who expect gruesome Cat III horror in the tradition of `` '' Diary of a Serial Killer '' '' or `` '' Red to Kill '' '' will be disappointed , but fans of sleazy exploitation cinema should give this one a look.7 out of 10 .

"`` Victor Sjöström 's `` '' Körkarlen '' '' plunges the viewer into life 's lower depths for much of its running time , with grim scenes of alcoholic degradation , family violence and suicidal despair , but the most memorable passages involve the mythic image of Death itself . Here Death is embodied as a ghostly horse-drawn carriage , driven by a wretched sinner who was the last person to die on the previous New Year 's Eve . For one year the wretch must collect the souls of the newly departed , and after twelve months of this horrible servitude the driver 's own soul is finally released when the last person to die on December 31st becomes the new driver. < br / > < br / > The scenes involving this carriage ( the film was known as `` '' The Phantom Carriage '' '' or `` '' The Phantom Chariot '' '' in English-speaking countries ) are eerie and mesmerizing , utilizing double-exposure cinematography that was quite sophisticated for its time and still effective when seen today . Most strikingly , the carriage travels to the floor of the ocean to collect the soul of a person who drowned . As fascinating as these scenes are , however , the bulk of the film is concerned with the downward spiral of David Holm , played by the director himself in an understated portrayal of a man who has given up on the possibility of living a decent life . In flashbacks we see Holm enjoying a pleasant day at the beach with his wife , children and brother , and he appears to be a perfectly ordinary guy . Abruptly , without segue or explanation , we then see Holm as an alcoholic wreck , in trouble with the law and alienated from his family . Ordinarily this leap from Before to After might feel like a story-telling deficiency , but in this case the filmmakers trust us to fill in the familiar , sordid details on our own . It 's suggested that Holm has been led astray by his convivial friend Georges , the drinking companion who first relates the tale of the Phantom Carriage , but whatever the cause of his downfall Holm appears to be a lost cause , a mean-spirited drunk who takes perverse pleasure in inflicting pain on his family and in refusing to reform. < br / > < br / > While David Holm is our central figure the story 's true catalyst is a young Salvation Army nurse who takes a sympathetic interest in his case and doggedly believes in him despite his hateful behavior . When the nurse herself is dying -- indirectly due to her ministrations on Holm 's behalf -- she demands to see him , and thus inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that will result in his recovery. < br / > < br / > At times this film resembles Dickens ' tale of Scrooge in its use of ghostly visitors who inspire a deeply flawed man to take stock of his life , suffer over his misbehavior , and reform . I was also reminded of Sjöström 's 1917 drama `` '' Terje Vigen , '' '' in which a man returns from jail to find his house empty and his family gone ( a sequence echoed here ) . The director also reiterates a standard theme of Scandinavian folklore , found earlier in his `` '' Berg-Ejvind och hans hustru '' '' ( a.k.a . `` `` The Outlaw and His Wife , '' '' 1918 ) that no man can outrun his fate . This time , however , it could be argued that David Holm actually succeeds in evading his seemingly inevitable fate , for he 's given an unexpected second chance to make amends. < br / > < br / > Viewers expecting a plunge into the supernatural will appreciate the sequences featuring the Phantom Carriage of the title , but may not be prepared for this film 's painful examination of a troubled man 's alcoholic downfall . But those with a taste for intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate `` '' Körkarlen '' '' in its entirety . It stands with the best serious cinema of its era and is certainly one of Sjöström 's most accomplished works . ''",1,1
"Saw this film at the NFT in London where it was showing as part of the BFI 's John Huston season . I was n't really sure what to expect and the first few minutes of the film gave very little away . In fact the rest of the film continued to give little away ! No real plot , no action , no suspense , very little drama and , except for a short section at the very end , no scenery. < br / > < br / > The result of lack of all of these features was , however , a wonderful film . I do n't fully understand why , but I think that its understated nature made the film almost completely perfect . The acting , script and , most important of all , the casting were all spot on and I ca n't remember walking away from a cinema feeling so good , but I still ca n't work out why . I just know that I will be getting the DVD ( this is one of those films that will , I am sure , be just as good on the small screen as the cinema experience , provided that you can find somewhere quiet to watch it ! ) and I will be watching it again soon . I will be also interested to find out what my family and friends think of it . I 'm sure that it will not be everybody 's choice but I am convinced that a large number will agree with my view. < br / > < br / > 9 out of 10 .",1,1
"Before I start to tear apart this movie , mark you -- I LOVE THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL . That story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written . The movie staring Jane Grey is very good and the musical on Broadway is the hottest thing there . So , I thought when I heard that this film was coming out that it would be great since it was a BBC film. < br / > < br / > To my surprise , it was a weak , totally stupid story that UTTERLY failed in capturing the gorgeous tale. < br / > < br / > There were no exciting escapes with daring disguises . There was no deep love that made your heart flutter as Percy left the room and Marguerite sighed as her husband was leaving her again. < br / > < br / > All it had was a confusing plot and a lot of out-of-the-blue sex and violence. < br / > < br / > Sink me !

"Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp . The animation and voice acting were perfect for this type of film. < br / > < br / > I laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes or so of this movie ; mostly at the concept . After that , the joke wore thin . As a 15-20 minute animated short , Lil Pimp would have been a classic . Instead , this movie consists entirely of one joke that lasts far too long. < br / > < br / > Weathers , voiced by Ludicrous , does have several crude and funny one-liners . Unfortunately , that is all the boy 's pet rat is good for as he contributes nothing else to the story . Eventually , I grew as bored with his remarks as I did the rest of this movie. < br / > < br / > I am a big fan of South Park , and other animation aimed at adults . I also play several online pimp games , so I am partial to stories about pimps . The transition from little boy to lil pimp was brilliant ; but after that , both the story and dialog became redundant and predictable. < br / > < br / > I give this movie a five . It is worth watching for the great concept and voice acting . Just do not expect much else or you will be quite disappointed .",0,0
"There have been some harsh criticisms of Comanche Moon on IMDb . I think this is for three reasons . First , purists are disappointed that the mini-series is not exactly like the book . Second , it 's not as good as the original Lonesome Dove . Finally , people like to complain on IMDb and the greatest films in the world will have bad comments. < br / > < br / > I would like to say that no movie is going to be as good as the book . That 's just the way it is . Lonesome Dove was n't as good as the novel it was based on . Additionally , the movie of Lonesome Dove had some things left out ans switched around . That 's just they way its going to be with a film adaptation of anything . So its a futile argument when looking at Comanche Moon. < br / > < br / > I do agree it 's not as good as the original Dove . But hey , nothing is . I know people that guide their lives by the lessons they learned from the Dove . If I was going to compare every book I read , movie I watched , and TV I viewed by Lonesome Dove ; I would be perpetually unhappy. < br / > < br / > This is a made for TV miniseries based on a prequel to Lonesome Dave ( the novel ) and sequel to Dead man 's Walk , and that 's what you get . It 's the best TV I 've seen in years . It 's a fun set up for Lonesome Dove . We get to learn about the history of the Rangers we came to know and love in Dove . Zahn does an amazing job in recreating Gus McCrae . Elizabeth Banks and Linda Forenelli ( sp ? ) also do great jobs as creating characters that help fill in the past of the rangers and Newt. < br / > < br / > If/when it comes on again , I promise you 'll enjoy it more than some crumby reality show .",1,1
"`` This is a must-see movie . You will laugh , you will cry , and when it 's over you 'll wish there were more . Well-written and compelling , this movie draws you in and holds on tight . The casting was perfect , the characters purposeful , and the performances outstanding . `` `` Nanny '' '' is the standard to which all women should hold themselves : strong , forgiving , protective , and never judgmental . `` `` Nanny '' '' , to me , is the epitome of what a Christian mother and woman should be : a true pillar of the community . If I were half the woman `` '' Nanny '' '' is , I might consider myself to be doing okay . I would have been devastated if `` '' Nanny '' '' had died at some point in the movie , but since she did n't I will definitely buy this when it comes out on DVD . I can only hope that the story continues and that Ruben goes back to Lackawanna to try to rebuild the town , piece by piece and person by person . ''",1,1
"`` This movie is not what it appears to be . Clint Eastwood is not Dirty Harry or a `` '' cowboy '' '' here . The movie 's appeal comes from its careful manipulation of atmosphere and theme . It 's a Gothic tale set in the Civil War and as such all the film 's `` '' action '' '' , or lack thereof , takes place inside a house populated by Southern Belles of all ages and shapes. < br / > < br / > The horror comes from viewing the whole story through the eyes of the Clint Eastwood character . Seeing him stranded in the house and held captive by the women is a very `` '' beguiling '' '' experience indeed . And who is `` '' beguiled '' '' here exactly ? Are the women beguiled by Eastwood 's incredible looks ? Are we , the viewers , beguiled by both his sexual allure and the potential deviant sexualities it unleashes ? Or does `` '' beguiled '' '' refer to what the director does here -- holds us enthralled for a short space only to ( maybe ) let us go ? Don Siegel does all of the above in one of the most memorable and disturbing films I had the pleasure of watching . ''",1,1
"This is my favorite love story it has every element that a good love story should have . Poetry , jazz , friendships the ups and downs in a relationships . Finally a movie that shows positive aspects of the black community . Larenz Tate was great I ca n't picture anyone else playing the role of Darius . He recited that poem like he had written it himself and meant every word . I own this movie and if I had the time I would watch it everyday it always makes me feel better and that 's what a good movie should do . Also , the character Savon could not had been any better dealing with the subject of marriage . We would all like to find a Darius out there but most of us just settle for watching this movie .

"I kept waiting for the film to move me , inspire me , shock me , sadden me in some way but it stirred none of my emotions . It just meandered along to the end . None of the characters seemed very unique or complex , they just seemed like actors reciting their lines . I think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion . The only one who did and was believable was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could . It was a waste of talent , film , their time , and mine . If there is a message or meaning or genius in this story , it certainly is well-hidden or I am very dense , which I doubt .",0,0
"Steven Segal 's movie career is a tribute to horrible cinema . I have been tragically bored with every one of them as soon as I realized that they were even more unrealistic than Jean Claude VanDamme 's . Has anyone else ever noticed that he never gets hit ? ! I mean , give me something to root for ... a hard fought battle with a bad guy who 's scary . TWENTY YEARS and he 's still filming the same fight scenes . Fight scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero can not act . The boring choreography of a Segal film places his painful lack of acting skill in sharp relief . Worse yet , he 's woefully out of shape . Just what we need , a fat stiff who THINKS he 's a leading man . There 's not one iota of redeeming cinematic value in all this movies ninety or so minutes . Do NOT watch this unless you feel like throwing away an hour and a half of your life .",0,0
"I have to agree with what many of the other reviewers concluded . A subject which could have been thought-provoking and shed light on a reversed double-standard , failed miserably. < br / > < br / > Rape being a crime of violence and forced abusive control , the scenes here were for the most part pathetic . It would have been a better idea to cover short glimpses of what was happening and let the audience imagine the deed . And the victim 's laugh with the cops , when he aborted his police complaint , seemed as genuine as that of the cops . No awkwardness , no hesitance to merely join in . I do n't know if this was bad acting and or bad directing but someone missed the point entirely . As for his half-a**ed supposed search for his attackers , pathetic . They should have skipped most of the sex scenes - another monumental failure in themselves , and had him meet Colin Friels when he first went to the police . The story could have then been drawn forth with good dialog and the occasional flashback - and saved by the superior acting and presence Colin Friels - the only reason I watched this movie - brings to any project he does. < br / > < br / > The only concrete revelation of this movie , is , it was crap .",0,0
"`` I first saw this film by chance when I was visiting my uncle in Arizona about 3 and 1/2 years ago . The VHS print was a little faded looking , but I was very haunted by what I had watched . Did it all make sense ? Well , honestly , no it did n't . However , this is a film that requires more than one viewing to understand all of its aspects . The beautifully tragic score haunted me and the bizarre images made quiet an impression. < br / > < br / > Well , when I found out that Anchor Bay had released this oddity on DVD , I picked it up immediately . I was very pleased by the transfer , though I felt the extras rather lacking . Though the film concerns the `` '' O '' '' and Sir Stephen characters , it really has nothing to do with Pauline Reage 's original novel or the 1974 film The Story of O . However , the film does pay attention to artistic detail and symbolism of an almost mystic kind . `` `` O '' '' decides to prostitute herself for Sir Stephen in violent 1920s Hong Kong . Her mission is to prove her unending devotion and love for her master through giving her body to other men . Naturally , Sir Stephen enjoys watching her during her unpleasant sexual escapades and even finds himself a mistress . However , the tables are turned when `` '' O '' '' actually finds a kind of love with a young male admirer . Suddenly , Sir Stephen feels the threat ... < br / > < br / > I feel that the deep meaning behind the film ( including the tragic score and artistic direction ) really make this film a classic . The viewer is introduced not only to the lives and pasts of `` '' O '' '' 's fellow brothel mates , but the turmoil of 1920s Hong Kong is also explored . Like the political setting , the prostitutes all find themselves in need of belonging . No one is happy in the film , even if they believe that they are . ( However , `` '' O '' '' does find a sense of happiness with her young admirer ) . One prostitute tearfully remembers how her father used to act like a dog when she was drunk , naturally leading to a fetish for having her customers act like a dog . Another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress . She can not let that vision go . She treats her clients as co-stars and even swears she hears a piano in the river . < br / > < br / > As for `` '' O '' '' , she has a flashback about her father leaving her in a chalk circle . When he leaves , she feels a sense of abandonment . Of course , in that same flashback Kinski suddenly becomes her father . I was very , very disturbed by this image . I truly felt for `` '' O '' '' at this point in the film . She hardly ever smiles and this scene really explains why . Her fear of abandonment is so great that she sees Sir Stephen as her father and caters to his every obscene demand in hopes of proving her love . < br / > < br / > Another curious aspect of the film is the young child ( that ages at the end ) that sells fortune in a box . It is a very random character , but somehow it just adds to the sense of loss and emptiness in the film . At one point , the director even uses painted cardboard figures to represent people . Now , if that is n't symbolism for you ! ( Laugh ) < br / > < br / > All in all , I really love this film . I feel that it is a very deep and somewhat moving experience . It has erotic scenes , but the scenes are n't really meant to arouse . Like the lives of the characters , the sex acts are empty . They are motions , but lack feeling and tenderness . ( Once again , the only tender scene is between `` '' O '' '' and the young man ) . `` `` O '' '' believes she is in love and that lowering herself is an honor , however , she finds in the end that she has choices . She too can be her own person and pursue her own happiness , however , she also has the option to stay in that circle that her father drew . The director leaves a lot of unanswered questions , however , some things do n't need answers . The viewer will make the judgment that works for them . < br / > < br / > I must say that I wish a special edition of this DVD would be released that had director commentary . I think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion of the film and its message years later . It is a shame that the soundtrack was never released . This film has a truly haunting and heart breaking score . There is something about the lingering vocals that send a chill up my spine . I can truly feel the sense of loneliness in the film by just listening to the music . ''",1,1
"`` I like this movie above all others . It is `` '' multi-layered '' '' ; there is so much to see and appreciate . Every viewing brings a new appreciation of the story-line , the plot and the characters . Faultlessly acted and extremely enjoyable if you take the time to watch it and appreciate it . I love the interaction between the players ; the subtle relationships ; the period atmosphere . Ralph Fiennes is perfectly cast as the brooding lover and Geoffrey the wronged husband is beautifully underplayed by Colin Firth . The scene in the sand storm where Catherine & El-masy are discussing the different types of sand storms is one of the high-lights of the film and where the affair really starts . The other relationship between Hanna & El-masy is yet another `` '' layer '' '' of the movie which is totally enchanting ( and heart-rending ) . A worthy winner of so many awards . ''",1,1

"`` It is not surprising that this film was made by I 'm Kwon Taek at the time it was . He examined the early beauty and tragedy of Chosun Dynasty life in Seopyonje and delightfully explored a well-known Korean folk tale in Chunhyang , and these comprised his last two films . What is most surprising is that Chi Hwa Seon , his 2002 offering , is not presented in the pansori style of those previous two films. < br / > < br / > Nonetheless , the experienced hand of I 'm comes through . We explore together the life of a real person : a late nineteenth century Chosun Dynasty painter who rides on the edge of modernity but who is not a noble and who , because of that , causes a stir in contemporary Korean society with his fame and his public and artistic expressions of disdain for the old Korean noble class and his contempt for would-be Japanese ruling colonials alike . The painter , Chang Seung Up , known popularly as Oh Won ( performed magnificently by Choi Min Sik , the famous star of Park Chan Wook 's already legendary `` '' OldBoy '' '' ) becomes more and more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film . Contemporary Korean audiences will back a hero like this despite the fact , or maybe because of the fact , that he was so ostracized in his time . I'm 's sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remains intact . I 'm is a master at capturing his country 's past idiosyncrasies , and in this film he almost outdoes himself . As expected in an I 'm film , the cinematography is breathtaking , the editing is precise and the story is central. < br / > < br / > Plots are set against Seung Up , family ties are tested and broken , scandalous behavior is alleged ( and is sometimes real ) , all to bring down the man who `` '' painted fire . '' '' But against all the intricacies of I'm 's detailed but sometimes convoluted account of Seung Up 's life , Seung Up himself somehow manages to survive . He becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous Chinese paintings after only one look . Art dealers and agents then besiege him and try to make money off `` '' Oh Won . '' '' In other words , lines of people , who wish to take advantage of the real Seung Up , an artistic star , begin to form . But he refuses to be manipulated . His cleverness in staving off both the massive hordes and the imperial lackeys impresses the audience , if not the cast . < br / > < br / > What does Seung Up think ? He possesses powerful emotions and opinions about painting , such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and are never truly finished . He despises those who would try to turn art into profit . And he cares not for politicians who use their might to bring artistic beauty around them and then cast off the artist as traitorous . But he also thinks that painting plays a role in the coming upheavals . Horrid scenes involving foreign invaders from France and Japan are presented . I'm 's signature historical epic motif , and his influence in the realm , remains on prominent display in this multi-million dollar epic . < br / > < br / > The protagonist causes greater grief for himself and those who care for him when he refuses to paint . This is when the story takes on a whole new meaning , one that is not just political , but social in nature . I 'm takes on the issues in laudable realist fashion . < br / > < br / > He , Oh Won , becomes a Jesus figure . The people believe him capable of artistic miracles and the government feels it needs his artistic support , but the protagonist remains fiercely independent and contemptuous of what others want him to do or be . Eventually , both government and people come down upon Seung Up in a manner taken straight out of the Bible . His holiness becomes human ; his humanity is not accepted ; he dies for ( or escapes from ) the sins of the commoners , the art critics , the politicians , who hound him . < br / > < br / > But does he die ? As with most of I'm 's films , a question remains . In this case , does Seung Up really become an immortal hermit ? The film does not tackle that question ; it merely presents a possible end for the real man of Chang Seung Up , or Oh Won . No death is depicted because no death is known . < br / > < br / > It is difficult to find fault with this film , but I 'm has become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in his culture that when he does , it hardly surprises anymore . As usual for I'm 's films , the cinematography , the editing and the writing are all first rate . It 's a well-crafted film imbued with I'm 's uncanny story-telling ability . Granted , he may be best at doing this through the ancient Korean musical art of pansori . Still , the film contains stretches of this admirable art form , and by the end , viewers feel as if they have become privy to a great , untold story . And they have , because that , precisely , is I'm 's gift . ''",1,1

"Clouzot followed Le Corbeau , where no one knew who was penning the poison thus everyone was suspected , with another masterpiece , Quai des Orfevres four years later in which we know from the outset ( or think we do ) whodunnit . Top-billed Louis Jouvet does n't appear for forty minutes by which time Clouzot has established a rich milieu of Music Hall , music publishers , etc and a fine cast of colourful characters ; Angela Lansbury lookalike ( Lansbury appeared in Woman of Paris that same year ) Suzy Delair scores as the chanteuse whose desire to improve her lot inspires the jealousy of her husband/accompanist Bernard Blier who follows her to the home of an elderly letch only to find he is already dead .

At this point investigator Jouvet gets involved and from then on it 's a case of keeping the plates spinning in the air .

"I saw what I believe to be the best Australian film of the year so far , Jon Hewitt 's Acolytes. < br / > < br / > Acolytes is a stylish thriller with a killer premise . Get this two bullied and molested teens discover a local serial killer in their suburb AND then set about blackmailing him to kill the bully who molested them . Hewitt has picked a top notch cast including excellent new comers Sebastian Gregory , Josua Payne and Hanna Mangan Lawrence to play the teens . Add to that three , yes , thats right three great psycho 's ! Lead by Joel Edgerton in an outstanding performance of serial killer du jour , Belinda McClory his deranged spouse and Michael Dorman as the teen raping bully , with swastika tattoos . Once you add these teens and these menacing adults , all hell breaks loose Hewitt has crafted a balls to the wall serial thriller thats damn original and accomplished . You can see the influence of Larry Clark and David Lynch 's Twin Peaks but Hewitt makes it all his own , in a Qld suburban back water , always ringing with the drones of emptiness . The script by Shayne Armstong , Shane Krouse and Hewitt is tight. < br / > < br / > If marketed correctly this film could be a break out hit with teens . The next Wolf Creek ? It could well be . It makes all the right moves . The teens are real ala Larry Clark . They do n't suck and have an attached PC agenda , they are non communicative , good looking and hip . The killers are dark with real menace . Joel Edgerton steals his scenes as the mild mannered local Ted Bundy , who sports a butterfly on his 4WD spare ala John Fowles The Collector . Dorman 's petrol head rapist pours on the menace that tops Suburban Mayhem and provides a creepy thug who you ca n't wait to see buy the farm. < br / > < br / > The film is fast paced , tough and brutal . Not only that , it displays a confidence and directorial mastery from Hewitt that is surely to win him an IF or AFI nomination , if not award !

And maybe they could have a PASSIONATE KISS ! In my summary at the top I say that this qualify 's more as a piece of Cinema than just an extended episode . And it does ! The action is very cinematic and the animation quality looks very fancy especially during the fighting ! Overall , this is a excellent anime Film that is a must-see for any Naruto fan ! 5/5 ! 10/10 ! 50/50 ! 100/100 ! Alright I 'll stop !",1,1
"i 've heard a lot about the inventive camera-work and direction in this movie . i thought both were a mess < br / > < br / > also some truly terrible acting . the main 'heroine ' in the movie is irritating beyond belief and has absolutely nothing useful to contribute in any situation . everything she does or says is stupid , and she generally just seems to mess peoples lives up . if she could fight , i might forgive her < br / > < br / > overall all the women in this movie are stereotypical 'broads ' in need of a man to save them . and all the men in this movie are muscle bound dim wits capable of saving no one < br / > < br / > this is a poor movie , and i urge you to avoid it . watch something like 'the sword of doom ' instead , i hear its much better than this confusing mess of a film .",0,0
"`` The other day I showed my boyfriend a great movie , Stand By Me , a movie I have shown to many people and they absolutely adored it , but for some odd reason he did n't like it . He lends me a movie called Backdraft and he tells me that he 's shown it to many people and they loved it , instead I hated this movie . I do n't think I 've hated a movie so much in a while , how this movie has even a 6.6 rating is beyond me . I could n't keep up with the five million stories here : Billy Baldwin becoming a fire man , the random sibling rivalry , the random love story ( s ) , the who 's being an arson story , the investigator , the fire who has a personality of it 's own . I just have a problem that this movie ca n't keep up with all these stories , they did n't balance out well enough make the film interesting . I would have just preferred if this movie was about being a firefighter or the investigator and how he came to be one or what it is exactly he does and why. < br / > < br / > The movie tells the story of a group of Chicago firefighters , two brothers . Stephen `` '' Bull '' '' McCaffrey , the elder brother , is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights . Brian , the younger brother quit the fire fighting academy school several years before , then embarking on a number of other unsuccessful careers before returning to become a firefighter . He is looked down on by his elder brother who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as a fire fighter . Donald `` '' Shadow '' '' Rimgale is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession . He is called in because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections . .Martin Swayzak is an alderman on the City Council . He has obvious hopes of being elected to mayor , but has had to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department . Many of the rank and file firemen believe that the cuts that he has made are endangering the lives of the firefighters . However , Swayzak is initially successful in portraying the fire department as bloated and ineffectual after firemen are repeatedly being killed in blazes. < br / > < br / > I just could n't get into this movie , I do n't know how anyone else could , it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed firefighters all wrong . I loved how they had every action cliché in the book to match this action flick . I just felt also like there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles , Donald Sutherland , great actor , but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the upcoming talent at the time . I know Ron was going for great quality , but I think him casting such huge actors in small roles was a mistake for this film . I even had to joke my way through while watching this movie commenting how the doctor in the background was probably Kevin Spacey . The fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just so out there , I did n't enjoy it and honestly would n't recommend it to people , I 'll stick to the recommendations in my relationship from this point on. < br / > < br / > 2/10 ''",0,1
"`` For the record , I hate spoof movies . Except for Mel Brooks and AIRPLANE ! because those are classics and make fun of the clichés , not the actual movies itself .

I especially hate things created by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer , the `` '' geniuses '' '' behind DATE MOVIE , EPIC MOVIE , and MEET THE SPARTANS. < br / > < br / > I decided to give THE COMEBACKS a look . Since Friedberg and Seltzer had nothing to do with the production , I was as objective as possible . It was just like one of their movies . It was basically every sports movie rolled into one with lame kindergarten jokes , and disturbing images of bodily injury that 's supposed to make me laugh and failed. < br / > < br / > Only someone high would laugh at these jokes . Toilet bowl ? Who wrote this ? an 11 year old ? I was surprised to see that this was the creation of the producers of WEDDING CRASHERS , which was actually pretty decent . But there attempt at the spoof genre was about as funny as a burning orphanage . The only reason that I gave this two stars ( when it clearly deserved one ) was because Friedberg & Seltzer had nothing to do with this . ''",0,0

Definitely not what the DVD cover claims , `` '' Destined to be the next stoner classic '' '' , hardly. < br / > < br / > Wardrobe and hairstyles are done well and yes , there are some really pretty girls in this , always nice to see a good looking cast. < br / > < br / > Almost every scene contained guitar that just droned on and on .

"`` Hick Trek is clearly a film that is envious of even an El Mariachi-level budget ( $ 7,000 ) . Still , the creators are able to pull off decent effects at times ( often due to great editing ) such as the beamings , the situations aboard the cat ship , and Slim T. Jerk 's unique way of communicating with his ship without use of a traditional communication device. < br / > < br / > The acting does have its rough spots but the portrayal of `` '' Horns '' '' McBoy is excellent and Fluffy is certainly not too hard on the eyes. < br / > < br / > I do wish that the film had been longer than its approximate hour - and that should be seen as a compliment . This movie is a success due to the sincerity and hard work of those involved . ''",1,1
"`` The limited scenery views were the only saving grace to an otherwise uneventful and boring movie . The acting was borderline absurd which I blame on the script and screenplay .

After watching this I was left with the feeling that some friends had some free time and decided to make a movie . It must have been produced on a budget of pocket change . The plot was thin at best and with the low caliber of acting at times it begged the question to be asked , `` '' Why are we doing this ? '' '' . I managed to sit through the entire movie but also asked myself , `` '' Why ? '' '' . ''",0,0
"`` This is a beautifully-made film , finely balancing the fragile human stories ( both before and after 1945 ) and the indiscriminating combat of war . The use of outtakes from Battle of Britain ( a film that does not nearly so well portray the 1940s ! ) enhances , rather than detracts from the whole . A deeply impressive work , this lived in my memory for the 2 years since I saw it , and I have just bought it to explore the making-of extras. < br / > < br / > I highly recommend this film ( movie ) . Like `` '' Aces High '' '' , it alternates between viscerally exciting ( or scary ) air combat sequences , where the viewer might experience actual loss of characters they 'd come to care about , but also unpredictable interactions on the ground , where skillful writers and real-life experiences inform some involving and moving events . This also underlines the fact that for many people , 1945 marked not just the end of one conflict but the beginning of another , and even today we still do n't recognise the loss , bravery and sacrifice of so many nameless heroes , or even worse we venerate them from a distance without allowing them to be human beings with all the emotional weaknesses that entails - making their sacrifices all the more valiant. < br / > < br / > Watching this movie is an experience which will take you from the heights of friendship to the depths of jealousy , and back to love that endures even beyond death .

"`` When going to see Rendition , I was expecting an exciting film on a controversial topic with big-name actors . I was not expecting a film that was so engrossing , exciting , poetic , and sad that picked me up from the very beginning and did n't let me go , even after I left the theater . A word of advice to anyone who has n't seen it yet , do n't let your politics come in the way of enjoying ( or not enjoying ) this film . Take it for what it is . I saw this with my conservative Jewish family ( I 'm the black sheep , the pseudo-liberal college student ) and I thought they would write it off as `` '' liberal propaganda '' '' . Instead , they said it was a great film with excellent performances ( they like to fancy themselves film critics ) . < br / > < br / > It 's sad that a movie like this has to be marketed by its Oscar-affiliated actors , while leaving out the constantly underrated Sarsgaard as well as new talent like the truly excellent Metwally . The entire cast gave good performances , with some standing out much more than others ; my only problem with it was that there was a lot going on which did n't allow for much screen time for each of the characters . In fact , I felt like the `` '' sub-plot '' '' with Fatima and Khalid was just as prominent on screen as Anwar 's part of the story. < br / > < br / > The characters all have the potential to fall into stereotypes , but the actors do a good enough job to give them depth with the little screen time they have . Streep is truly terrific , as a heartless senator , and as much as I do n't want to see the actress in such a terrible role its impossible not to believe her . Gyllenhaal , who will probably be one of the Oscar nods for this movie , seems a bit unsure in his role at times . H 's trying to portray his inner conflict but usually just comes off like he either forgot his lines or he does n't know how he should feel . Sarsgaard gave an excellent performance ; his unforgettable confrontation with Streep is easily one of the best parts of the movie . Metwally , again , was terrific , and I hope to see him in more mainstream films . It 's a shame that Gyllenhaal with probably get nominated before him . Yigal Naor , as shown on IMDb , has been is some films already but he is a newcomer in my eyes . He , along with Mohammed Khouas and Zineb Oukach , all gave great performances. < br / > < br / > The story of Fatima and Khalid was not given any credit in commercials , but it brings a sad humanity to the story . The narrative was interesting as I was trying to really connect the two story until it was plainly told to us at the end . I 've read some comments on here that say the love story was useless , but I disagree . I think it definitely shows another side to the controversial issue as well as humanity in general . Khalid was the real terrorist , but he was doing it to avenge his brother , and even though he is responsible for the attack , you see a humane side to him through the story with Fatima . Not that I think we should feel bad for actual terrorists , but I think the `` '' we are all people '' '' theme was definitely relevant. < br / > < br / > Whatever your feelings on terrorism , politics , etc . leave it out of the theater . The bottom line is this is an interesting story with a message we all need to hear . ''",1,1

"Pepe le Moko , played by Charles Boyer , is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout Europe , and to stay free he holes himself up in the Casbah , a mysterious part of Algiers where even the police are reluctant to go , until a senior officer is sent from Paris to capture le Moko once and for all . For le Moko , although the Casbah allows him to remain out of police custody , it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time - a place he ca n't leave , because the moment he does , he knows he 'll be arrested. < br / > < br / > Boyer 's performance was good , and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar . He captures the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time . The movie itself , unfortunately , was quite a letdown . A number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent , of which I 'll mention two . First was the idea that the police would n't enter the Casbah . That was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander , and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the Casbah fairly regularly . So , neither the suggestion by Commissioner Janvier that the police would n't enter , nor the statement by Inspector Slimane ( also a decent performance by Joseph Calleia ) that they could get into the Casbah but not out seemed to make much sense . I also found it difficult to believe that le Moko - hardened criminal mastermind that he was - could be so quickly swept off his feet by Gaby ( Hedy Lamarr ) to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the Casbah to find her , essentially giving himself up . I understand the irony of the final few scenes , of course , as Pepe leaves the freedom of his prison ( the Casbah ) only to find real freedom in his capture ( because he 's shot and killed by the police . ) I just found it impossible to believe that someone like le Moko would fall into such a trap. < br / > < br / > This is worth watching for Boyer , and to a lesser extent Calleia , but the story is disappointing and inconsistent . 3/10",0,1
"This is an extremely involving series that is well casted and portraits a sensitive subject with great splendor .

Icey cold on the outside , but still a good human being underneath trying his best to keep his head afloat in a highly emotional roller-coaster ride that FBI has had him embark on . Oder Fehr on the other hand comes off a guy that pretty much could fit into any social scenario . Big and strong , but yet able to disappear into the gray mass if so needed .

"`` In 1976 a mother named Norma Lewis ( Cameron Diaz ) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur ( James Marsden ) . One night a box is placed on the doorstep of their home and the following morning they cut open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key . By the late afternoon , a man with terrible scarring on his face comes to their door and presents Norma with an offer . This man is Arlington Steward ( Frank Langella ) and he announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash . If they do n't press it , nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else . Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal . The incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties . Arthur , who is currently working for NASA , fails to be accepted into a new job he applies for and Norma , who is a teacher , learns that her faculty funding is being cut. < br / > < br / > One 's enjoyment for this bizarre sci-fi thriller , based on the short story `` '' Button Button '' '' by Richard Matheson , will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ludicrous premise . The opening of the film is particularly problematic in grounding itself in a sense of realism with the household . Richard Kelly 's previous film Donnie Darko cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes . Without the dream-like state of that far superior film , The Box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world , is entirely implausible . That Norma would also accept someone into her house that has almost the same scarring as Two-Face from The Dark Knight and believe this offer , seems equally contrived. < br / > < br / > If this sounds unlikely so far , what follows is even more absurd , involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning , the possibility of alien life or some other Godly being influencing these situations . Scenes involving gateways opening up in public libraries , random nose bleeds and mindless drones stalking the Lewis family , become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity . To a point , the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going . Kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to hold our attention through many of the films contrivances . In one scene Norma is teaching a class and then is asked by a strange boy about her foot . He taunts her about it as she is missing four of her toes . Later , at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that Norma and Arthur are attending , this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be stalking them . Yet the eventual justification for these all of these oddities is wrapped up in a highly contrived sci-fi revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow. < br / > < br / > What is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early on , many of the moral implications that were initially promised are diminished for much of pictures duration . The ending , which wo n't be spoilt here , resurfaces these moral questions again in the hope of echoing that of a Greek tragedy . While the resemblances can be seen , by this point , given the unlikelihood of so much of the film and the uneven performances , there is little reason to care . Cameron Diaz 's Southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly Langella who is the most disappointing in the film , with a very unsubtly written role , as the mysterious scarred man , who seems to be hiding a military base that would make Dr . Evil proud . It really is just a shadow of his towering performance in Frost/Nixon . There is not a lot for many of the other actors in the film to do ; in particular both Norma and Arthur could not be regarded as characters but mouthpieces for Kelly 's pastiche of ideas . Underdeveloped and brief conversations , such as where Norma sympathises with Arlington over their deformities and also when Norma and Arthur question whether they really know each other in case the button kills either of them , highlights this. < br / > < br / > Since 2001 , Richard Kelly has failed to make a film that has lived up to the quality and the imagination of Donnie Darko . Though this film might be intriguing for a little while , it is too absurd and implausible to be fully enjoyed and it would certainly not warrant multiple viewings given the film 's rather illogical revelations . Science fiction fans might be able to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions , but what Kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains cryptic . The Box is one film this year that should have been shelved . ''",0,1
"I started watching this one very tensed because I heard so many different things about it . Somewhere I read it was a drama about child abuse and rated PG-13 for violence . Another critic said it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure of kids ( and I thought it was also for kids to watch ) . Well , now I 've seen it so many times and still do n't know in which category to put it . It is extremely funny at times but terribly sad and depressing the next moment . Because of the nice relationship and the adventures I would like to recommend this film to all the youngsters I know but I fear the somber atmosphere is not suitable for children . Because of the perfect performances and the magic of the film I must say this nevertheless : Watch it , especially the kids ! The last thing I have to say is that I hate the scriptwriter for letting poor Bobby never see his family again after having fled from The King ( who did n't even return to terrorize the remained Mary and Mikey ) . It is very good for this film not to have a perfect happy ending with everybody being happy - and I did n't expect it to - but this solution left me very , very sad !",1,1
"Though often considered Peter Sellers ' worst film , it is in fact an excellent send-up of medical corporate corruption and abuses of power . Often misunderstood , the film is actually a departure from the type of film Sellers was best known for ; satirical farce . This film had excellent performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita ( of Happy Days and the Karate Kid movies ) , but was marked by its ribaldary , irreverence , and total madcap demolition of the medical industry of the day . It was ahead of its time ( 1972 ) in taking the outrageous path that the Monty Python crew would take into the cinema some time later . As such , it was unacceptable to the traditional Peter Sellers fan , who found the more pointed barbs in this humor to be something to which they were unaccustomed . Presently , Peter Sellers movies are in demand by fans , but this effort , Where Does It Hurt ? , has by its nature become almost impossible to find .",1,1

"`` Seriously ! You 've just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it . It came out during the time period where everybody was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy ( The little rascals ; Mr. Nanny , etc . ) yet it lacked any charisma or enthusiasm . Every single character in the movie is driven by rage , with the exception of Trixie 's mother , who shows only aggravation and weariness , possibly at the tired cliché 's this movie enjoys . < br / > < br / > To put it simply , the biggest flaw in the film was not the acting , nor the filming , but most notably the writing . The lines we receive are reminiscent of Disney classics , although this film lacks the whole-heartedness IL ' Walt managed to pull off . Junior 's Dad , ( John Ritter ) makes you mad without even doing anything , simply because he allows Junior to run around unsupervised , and only gives him a stern warning when he tapes a 200-pound behemoth to a chalk board . < br / > < br / > Also , Junior 's grandfather is particularly excruciating . For those of you who saw the first one , found it nauseating , and thus , did not see the second one , `` '' Big Ben Healy '' '' as he is referred to in this movie , is still a total douche . He basically barges into John Ritter 's house uninvited , settles himself in Junior 's room , even though he says that he hates Junior , and basically does nothing to accelerate the film 's speed , or to support the film in any way . Rather , he ticks off the audience by being a lazy free loader. < br / > < br / > Finally , we are introduced to a wide variety of new characters , such as the smug , obnoxious , Trixie , who carries dynamite in her backpack , which she first lights , then hands , to Junior , who simply stares wide eyed at .
